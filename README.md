# GoodFood Project

## Overview
The GoodFood Project is a community-driven recipe sharing platform built on the ASP.NET MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework. Unlike traditional websites, MVC separates the application logic into three interconnected components: the Model (data and business logic), the View (user interface), and the Controller (handles user input and interacts with the model and view).
## Features
- **User Recipe Submission:** Any logged-in user can contribute their culinary creations by submitting recipes through the application.
- **Database Storage:** Utilizing SQL Express as the backend database to securely store the submitted recipes and associated metadata.
- **Dynamic Content:** The application dynamically presents the content of the database in the form of engaging articles, enhancing accessibility and readability for users.
- **Search Functionality:** Users can search for specific recipes or ingredients within the database, making it easier to discover new dishes.
- **User Profiles:** Each user has a personalized profile where they can manage their submitted recipes and engage with other community members.
- **Rating and Commenting:** Users can rate and comment on recipes, fostering interaction and feedback within the community.
- **Responsive Design:** The platform is designed to provide a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes, ensuring accessibility for all users.
